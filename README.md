# My R Journey
## Introduction and Aims
This is a repo containing bits and pieces for my journey into using R.

I aim to use this README as an ongoing commentary on my journey to using R, with 3 specific goals in mind:
1. Develop my own skills as a new analyst.
2. Investigate using R to compliment PowerBI, particularly with developing better and easier to produce visualisations.
3. Invesitgate the potential of R as a key statistical tool to go alongside the others used within my team, particularly with machine learning and AI.

I aim to make everything I make available to everyone, where possible, or at the very least document my code/methodology in such away that it can be used by anyone.

## My Background
A bit of information about my current knowledge level and background taken at the beginning of this journey so that I myself can reflect on where I have come from on my journey, and that those finding this can also see where I have come from as my style develops.

My undergraduate degree is in Physics, so statistics and number crunching are not a new thing for me. However a lot of the statistical analysis done during my time was either on a theoretical basis, with no experience using it, or done "by hand" using pen, paper and a calculator. I had learned some Pascal, Javascript and Python both at school and during my degree but again had no outlet to put these in to practical use beyond my course.

When I started my first job after university, I learned some SQL. I was however limited in my use of SQL and other programming languages as, although I'm sure it could have provided very useful, there was no push for it from anyone and I stuck mostly to Microsoft Excel.

I undertook a Masters in Information Systems and Business Analysis where I had a module on Machine Learning and statistical tools, using the IBM SPSS Modeller. After that I started my current role where I have been able to use SQL a lot more and have been encouraged to develop and use my existing, albeit basic knowledge of programming and see what uses can be taken from it.

After participating in a training session on R, I am convinced of its power for its purpose and aim to develop my skills to meet the goals I have outlined above.

## Learning Roadmap
- To start, I aim to use some pubicly available data sets and create some visuals. I will then aim to duplicate my code within PowerBI. This will be used as a "proof of concept" to show that it is possible to produce R visuals within PowerBI. My desired outcomes from this are that I will develop knowledge in common plotting and visualisation packages such as ggplot2, and learn how to replicate these in PowerBI using the R visualisation integration.
- Next, I will investigate visualisations not available within PowerBI and see if there are existing visualisations already written in R, the main one of these I hope to use being SPC charts. Again once I can produce these in R, I will aim to replicate them in PowerBI.
- After, I will use more R visuals in my PowerBI reports going forward to show real use cases.
- As I am doing this, I will also be comparing using R to using NCSS, documenting my personal findings here. As I am new to both, I feel it will be a fair comparison, although will obviously be biased to whichever one suits my style more.
- I will also be using data sets to investigate applications of machine learning, using R. My initial investigation will be forecasting population growth within the areas of the Black Country using information from the 2011 and 2021 UK Census, and using this to estimate the number of GP appointments that will be made each year for the next few years. Again this is more as a proof of concept showing the capabilities of R.
